# Javascript/HTML/CSS - Stretch Timer 

A very crude and simple timer for a group of "sessions". I use it for a morning stretching routine. Let me know if you find other uses for it. 

The "Enter Session Timer" screen is annoying, but it is an easy solution to the browser restrictions on loading and playing audio prior to user interactions. 

I could load the audio on "Start", but it would add complexity and possibly a delay to the start logic. Maybe later. Let me know if you have any thoughts on it.

## Acknowlegements

I am grateful for the use of the sound files from freesound.org. 
I converted from wav to mp3 for compression. I posted the compressed versions I made with this project. 
My contributions and modifications to the sound files are unrestricted (same as the code).
But these original sounds have license restrictions, so you should reference them if you are considering redistribution.

## Deployment

There are minimal depenencies in the source code. You can run in a browser as local files. 

There are no external links or references.

The directory structure is arbitrary and easily changed. CSS and JS are
specified in stretch.html. The audio files are specified in stretch.js

It uses browser local storage to store user presets.
